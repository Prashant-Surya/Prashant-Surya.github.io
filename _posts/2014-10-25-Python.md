##Python Fun

Until I learnt this python language, the name 'Python' just used to remind me about a kind of snake. But after learning

it, it became a part of my programming routine.

Python, an easy language to start learning programming. It works on interpretation rather than compilation and execution.

Python language initially focussed just on scripting,but now anything can be done using python. No declarations,no 

useless stuff where we waste so much time declaring..

Some examples of python implementations I am going to work with are Django, Pygame..
