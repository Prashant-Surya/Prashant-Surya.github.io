##Python and Codechef

Codechef... After a long time I now submitted many answers in codechef. I always got problems with declarations of large 

sized values in C. In python there is no problem with declarations. But I always used to get NZEC error. Using stdin 

instead of input() removed that error.

Codechef provides a problem [INTEST](http://www.codechef.com/problems/INTEST) to test if the process we are using to take 
inputs is sufficient for taking large inputs

But as input() is faster than stdin some programs I do in python are getting Time Limit Exceeded Error. My next aim is to 
work on time limit. And design better and faster code..

Python 2.7 supports

```
    import psyco
    psyco.full()
```

That speeds up the programs from 2 to 100 times faster. But it is not seen in python3. So I need to find new methods to 

speed up my py code or to learn how to handle large inputs and declarations in C.
