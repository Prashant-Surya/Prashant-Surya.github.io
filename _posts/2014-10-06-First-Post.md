##Hello World
#Computer Science way of saying hello :P

I always wanted to blog.. I created a blog in wordpress.. Blogging in sites like blogger,wordpress is like posting status updates in social networking sites.. If you can create a site, design it, develop it why still use those websites ?

So, I decided to design my blog and develop it.

I added a new post here using markdown language. Not just typing into a text box and clicking post..

I wanted my favourite programming language Python to back it. But using nikola powered by python became difficult for me due to less documentation..

Then I used jekyll Ruby blog generator to help me with creating my blogs. 

Now the blog you are seeing is created using jekyll bootstrap...
